\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of the RASD 
\emph on
(Requirements Analysis and Specification Document
\emph default
) is to give a detailed description, analysis and specification of the requireme
nts for the 
\emph on
myTaxiService
\emph default
 software.
 This document will explain the 
\emph on
goals
\emph default
 coming from stakeholders' expectations, the characterstics of the application
 domain and the 
\emph on
assumptions
\emph default
 made to solve ambiguity and incompleteness.
 Starting from goals and domain propertis, 
\emph on
requirements
\emph default
 will be formulated according to a specific systematic methodology and then
 specified using both informal and formal notations.
 However this document should not be considered the final draft for the
 software specifications since in the following phases several fixing may
 be necessary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objective of the RASD is to achieve good understanding among 
\emph on
analysts, developers, testers
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
customers
\emph default
, in particular explaining both the application domain and the system to-be;
 it is also aimed to be a solid base for project planning, software evaluation
 and possible future manteinance activities.
 Therefore this document is primarily intended to be proposed to the stakeholder
s for their approval, to the analysts and programmers for the development
 of the project and to the testing team the validation of the first version
 of the software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Present system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the moment taxi service is entierly managed by phone calls.
 A passenger who wants to request or reserve a taxi has to contact the call
 center.
 In case of request, the call center operator moves the call to the first
 available taxi, otherwise, in case of reservation, a taxi is booked for
 the specific date, time and address provided by the passenger.
 No available taxi queues management is implemented at the moment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
myTaxyService
\emph default
 is an appliation intended to optimize taxi service in a large city, making
 the access to service simpler for the passengers and ensuring a fair management
 of the taxi queues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Passengers will be able to request a taxi either through a web application
 or a mobile app; of course the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

traditional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ways to call for a taxi, like a phone call or stopping the taxi along the
 road, will be still available and integrated into the system to-be.
 The software will make the procedure of calling a taxi simpler (by using
 GPS information passenger has not to know the address if the taxi is needed
 for the current position) and more usable (passenger will be provided with
 information about the waiting time).
 Moreover, by means of the application, the passenger can reserve a taxi
 for a specific date and time, specifying the origin and the destination
 of the ride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taxi drivers will use a mobile app to inform the system about their avilability
 and to confirm that they are going to take care of a call (or to reject
 it for any reason).
 The software will make the taxi management more efficient: the system will
 be able to identify the position of each taxi by using GPS; the city will
 be divided in virtual zones and a suitable distribuction of the taxi among
 the zones will automatically be computed.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Requirement engineering approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to ensure a sound and complete requirement engineering acritivty,
 we decided to follow a sistematic technique for requirements formulation
 proposed by Jackson and Zave.
 This approach is based on the distinction between the 
\emph on
mac
\emph default
hine, the portion of the system to be developed (myTaxiService in our case),
 and the 
\emph on
world
\emph default
, the portion of the real world interacting with the machine.
 Machine and world are tipically non disjoint, some phenomena may affect
 both of them, they are known as shared phenomena.
 From this viewpoint, requirement engineering consists in identifing phenomena
 shared between world and machine, according to a set of 
\series bold
goals 
\series default
(which express the desired behiviour of world phenomena, shared or not)
 and a set of 
\series bold
domain assumptions
\series default
 (assertion supposed to be always valid in the world).
 Formally a set of 
\series bold
requirements 
\series default
is complete if together with domain assumption it ensures the goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting from the available documentation, integrated with some inteviews
 with the stakeholders, the following minimal goals has been identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[G1] Allow a passenger to request a taxi for its current position without
 registration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[G2] Allow the passenger to visualize the waiting time and the code of the
 incoming taxi for confirmed requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[G3] Allow a registered passenger to have a personal area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[G4] Allow a registered passenger to reserve a taxi.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[G5] Allow a registered passenger to cancel or modify a previous reservation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[G6] Allow a taxi driver to either accept or reject a request coming from
 the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[G7] Allow a taxi driver to inform the system about his/her availability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[G8] Ensure that availabe taxi queues enjoy the properties specified in
 subparagraph 1.6.2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Queue management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paragraph is aimed to give a more precise definition of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fair management
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the available taxi queues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The city is diveded into several zones, to each zone a taxi queue is assigned.
 Each zone is characterized by a different load of requests 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 mesured in request/minute.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 be the total number of taxis available at a certain moment, the number
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 of taxis avalable in the zone 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 has to be proportional and also periodically to 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

, in particular 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}=Nn_{i}/\sum_{i}n_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Every time one taxi turns from availabe to busy or out of service or viceversa
 a new distribuction of the taxies has to be computed; the taxis to be moved
 have to minimize the cost of movement calculated as number of zones passed
 through.
 To prevent too many movements, a fluctuating between -30% and 30% from
 the value 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is accepted without performing taxi movements.
