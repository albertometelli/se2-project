\section*{i{*} modeling}

The i{*} framework was developed for modelling and reasoning about
organizational environments and their information systems {[}2{]}.
It consists of two main modelling components. TheStrategic Dependency
(SD) model is used to describe the dependency relationships among
various actors in an organizational context. The Strategic Rationale
(SR) model is used to describe stakeholder interests and concerns,
and how they might be addressed by various configurations of systems
and environments {[}1{]}. We think that such a model can be a useful
instrument for requirement engineering because it is able to highlight
relationships between different levels of abstraction showing how
\emph{tasks} cooperates to fullfil \emph{goals} and how non functional
requirements (known ad \emph{soft goals} in the model) are affacted.
In this section we provide a simple model (Strategic Rationale model)
of a part of the TS system by using i{*} notation.
