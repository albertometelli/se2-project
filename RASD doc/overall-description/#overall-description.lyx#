Product perspective 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
myTaxiService
\emph default
 (TS) software can be decomposed into four different interacting subsystems
 (Figure 1):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the 
\emph on
passenger web application
\emph default
 (PWA): it's a web portal that allows passenger to request a taxi, register,
 login, reserve a taxi and cancel or modify previous reservations.
 PWA has to be able to identify passenger's position using, if available,
 the browser geolocalization support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the 
\emph on
passenger mobile application 
\emph default
(PMA): it's an application that shall be installed on passengers' smartphone
 performing the same functions of PWA.
 PMA needs also to communicate to a GPS application within the mobile phone,
 if any available, to retrieve the passenger's position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the 
\emph on
taxi driver mobile application
\emph default
 (TMA): it's an application that shall be installed on taxi drivers' smartphone
 in order to allow them to receive requests coming from the system, decide
 to confirm or reject requests and inform the system about their availability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the 
\emph on
queue management system
\emph default
 (QMS): it's a software aimed to compute realtime the distribution of the
 taxis in the city interfacing with the GPS system of each taxi, decide
 which taxi assign to a request and send to taxi drivers several notifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TS has also to be integrated with the previous taxi management system based
 on phone calls in order to allow call center operators to forward requests,
 therefore a specific interface shall be designed.
 Moreover, the system has to be provided with specific interfaces and APIs
 in order to allow future requirements extensions.

\begin_layout Subsection
User characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Main addressee of myTaxiService are passengers and taxi drivers.
 Users are not expected to have specific knowledge or technical expertise
 but it is assumed they are able to operate the internet and to have access
 to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Constraints 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Regulatory policies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following regulatory policies has to be met by the software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since user's geographic position needs to be shared within the application
 (either PMA or PWA) to ensure the expected behavior of the system, users
 has to agree in advance to specific terms and conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Taxi drivers are obliged not to spread possible collected information about
 passengers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hardware limitations 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following hardware limitations has to be met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mobile passengers has to download the free application from the store (PlayStore
 for Android users, AppStore for iPhone users, Windows store for Windows
 users).
 It is assumed that the mobile phones have enough primary memory to run
 the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The browser used by web passengers to access the system must have cookies
 enabled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each taxi driver is provided with a smartphone and the application TMA must
 be installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Domain assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the specific application domain and according to the information
 provided by stakeholders we can assume that the following assertions are
 always valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D1] A taxi driver always executes indications communicated by the system
 (e.g.
 move notifications), except in case of emergency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D2] Each taxi is provided with a GPS system.
 If GPS system is not available taxi is considered out of service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D3] A taxi can be stopped along the road by a passenger if and only if
 it is waiting without passenger or moving but not for carrying out a request.
 In this case taxi driver informs the system about his/her unavailability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D4] When a taxi driver finishes to carry out a request he/she informs the
 system about his availability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D5] When a taxi driver starts his work-shift sets his/her state from out
 of service to available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D6] When a taxi driver ends his work-shift if the current state is available
 then the taxi state becomes out of service; otherwise taxi driver finishes
 to carry out the current request and after that the taxi becomes out of
 service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D7] When a taxi driver gets to the meeting place, waits for 10 minutes;
 if passenger does not arrive taxi driver informs the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D8] A taxi is assigned to a unique taxi driver at time.
 It is possible that some taxi drivers are not assigned to any taxi or vice
 versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D9] If a ride gets out of the city the taxi driver comes back to the last
 zone before informing TS of his availability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D10] There are only two types of taxi: normal (4 seats) and minivan (9
 seats).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D11] Each available taxi belongs to exactly one queue at time.
 Busy or out of service taxis do not belong to any queue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D12] TS is available only in the city, no requests coming from outside
 of the city boundary are accepted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D13] Taxi drivers have always access to the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D14] Taxi drivers' work-shifts are managed in order to ensure that at each
 moment the number of in service taxis is at least 50% of the total number
 of taxis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D15] Taxi drivers go in emergency state only in case of car accident or
 similar events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
[D16] Taxi can move without limitations inside the zone assigned by TS system
 but they cannot change the zone without a notification from the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that also taxi drivers are identified by the system but registration
 of the taxi driver is not part of the TS system since it reasonably involves
 contractual issues (taxi driver has to make an agreement with the societhat
 cannot be managed by the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Possible future extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following are reasonable possible future extensions to the TS system;
 they are mainly meant to further improve the usability and the performances
 of the service.
 They will not be discussed in details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At present, queues has a fixed suitable number of available taxis which
 is supposed to be calculated using previous data about the number of requests
 coming from each zone.
 However the distribution of the requests can vary not only 
\emph on
spatially
\emph default
 (from one zone to an other) but also 
\emph on
temporally
\emph default
 (for each zone at different moments of the day the number of requests might
 be different).
 Also in different days of the week the distribution of requests may vary
 significantly.
 A possible solution to make TS more adaptive is the one in which the suitable
 number of taxis for each queue is periodically determined integrating data
 collected from the requests in a certain time horizon (for instance once
 a week).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At the moment TS system does not handle payments, since users are expected
 to pay the ride cash or with credit card to the taxi driver; online payments
 can be implemented within TS system.
 Both PWA and PMA should allow registered users to pay the price of the
 ride using credit card or paypal; cash payment should be still possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At the moment, passenger requesting a taxi can only see the estimated waiting
 time and the code of the taxi, while visualizing also the current position
 of the incoming taxi should be more useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An evaluation system of the quality of service can be added, allowing passengers
 to express an opinion about taxis.
\end_layout
