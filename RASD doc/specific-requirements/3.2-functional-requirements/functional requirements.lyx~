\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
Moving
\emph default
 state from the outside is equivalent to 
\emph on
available
\emph default
 state, it is just used by TS to remember that the taxi is moving to a specific
 zone and avoid to move other taxis.
 In particular, that taxi during the movement is added at the end of the
 destination zone queue.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and it goes back to 
\emph on
available 
\emph default
when arrives to the specified zone.
