\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of ITPD (
\emph on
Integration Test Plan Document
\emph default
) is to give a detailed description of the plan for the integration test
 of the 
\emph on
myTaxyService 
\emph default
application.
 The integration test as a part of the V&V (Verification and Validation)
 process is executed after the unit test, which constiutes its main entry
 condition, and before the system and acceptance test; it is aimed to exercise
 the interaction between modules and the corresponding interfaces in order
 to check the compatibility against functional, performance and relaiability
 requirements.
 The preferred approach for integration testing is the 
\emph on
black-box 
\emph default
one since single modules are supposed to be already tested isolated and
 no simple coverege criteria can be defined.
 Applications can be composed of many modules and the relashions among them
 very intricate therefore an 
\emph on
integration test plan
\emph default
 is a key feature of the project plan and has to be compliant to architecture
 define in the DD and to the build plan, that describes the sequence in
 which modules will be compounded.
 The Integration Test Plan Document is intended to be the main reference
 for this process and it is mainly addressed to the integration test team.

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
myTaxyService
\emph default
 is an application intended to optimize taxi service in a large city, making
 the access to service simpler for the passengers and ensuring a fair management
 of the taxi queues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Passengers will be able to request a taxi either through a web application
 or a mobile app; of course the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

traditional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ways to call for a taxi, like a phone call or stopping the taxi along the
 road, will be still available and integrated into the system to-be.
 The software will make the procedure of calling a taxi simpler (by using
 GPS information passenger doesn't need to know the address if the taxi
 is needed for the current position) and more usable (passenger will be
 provided with information about the waiting time).
 Moreover, by means of the application, the passenger can reserve a taxi
 for a certain date and time, specifying the origin and the destination
 of the ride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taxi drivers will use a mobile app to inform the system about their availability
 and to confirm that they are going to take care of a call (or to reject
 it for any reason).
 The software will make the taxi management more efficient: the system will
 be able to identify the position of each taxi by using GPS; the city will
 be divided in virtual zones and a suitable distribution of the taxi among
 the zones will automatically be computed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Document Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is composed of five sections and an appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first section, this one, is intended to define the goal of the ITPD,
 a very high level description of the main functionalists of the 
\emph on
myTaxiService
\emph default
 system and the resources used to draw up this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The second constitutes the core of the test plan.
 This section is devoted to the description of the integration test strategy:
 the preconditions required to start the integration test will be presented,
 the main rationals behind the chosen strategy will be discussed; the elements
 to be integrated will be listed with reference to the ones presented in
 the DD.
 Eventually the sequence of integration steps will be clearely illustrated
 distinguishing between the different levels of abstraction adoped to perform
 the test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The third section contains the definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The fourth section is dedicated to the user interface design.
 Starting from the mockup provided in the RASD and integrating information
 related to non functional requirements a more specific description will
 be given both in terms of new mockups and user interface graph structure
 expressed by means of UX diagrams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The fifth section is the link between DD and RASD: here we will emphasize
 how design choices described in the DD will realize the requirements expressed
 in the RASD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The appendix contains a brief description of the tools used to produce this
 documents and the number of hours each group member has worked towards
 the fulfillment of this deadline.
