Purpose

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Project management
\emph default
 represents a necessary condition for the success of any software project.
 Considered the intrinsic complexity of a software project, the difficulty
 in assessing the quality of the software and the organizational, economical,
 social and technical issues to be tackled in any enterprise environment,
 project management cannot be avoided.
 It comprises all the activities aimed to ensuring the delivering of the
 software on schedule and in accordance with context and requirements; in
 particular project planning, reporting, risk management and people management.
 The 
\emph on
PP
\emph default
 (
\emph on
Project Planning
\emph default
) is intended to be a trace of the myTaxiService project process.
 For academic reasons, this document is delivered as last assignment but
 it refers to both activities to be completed before the project initiation
 and activities to be performed during and at the end of the project.
 In particular this document is focused on 
\emph on
project planning
\emph default
 (estimation and scheduling of the process development, assignment of resources)
,
\emph on
 risk management 
\emph default
(definitions, strategies to tackle risk) and 
\emph on
cost estimation
\emph default
.
 In an enterprise environment the first two are typically performed before
 the project starts while the latter is executed either after the requirement
 engineering or after the design phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is intended to be read by stakeholders in order to show the
 devised organization of resources and time and to have a general overview
 of the effort needed to carry out the project useful for the evaluation
 of the founding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
myTaxyService
\emph default
 is an application intended to optimize taxi service in a large city, making
 the access to service simpler for the passengers and ensuring a fair management
 of the taxi queues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Passengers will be able to request a taxi either through a web application
 or a mobile app; of course the

traditional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ways to call for a taxi, like a phone call or stopping the taxi along the
 road, will be still available and integrated into the system to-be.
 The software will make the procedure of calling a taxi simpler (by using
 GPS information passenger doesn't need to know the address if the taxi
 is needed for the current position) and more usable (passenger will be
 provided with information about the waiting time).
 Moreover, by means of the application, the passenger can reserve a taxi
 for a certain date and time, specifying the origin and the destination
 of the ride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taxi drivers will use a mobile app to inform the system about their availability
 and to confirm that they are going to take care of a call (or to reject
 it for any reason).
 The software will make the taxi management more efficient: the system will
 be able to identify the position of each taxi by using GPS; the city will
 be divided in virtual zones and a suitable distribution of the taxi among
 the zones will automatically be computed.

Document Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is composed of six sections and an appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first section, this one, is intended to define the goal of the document,
 a very high level description of the main functionalists of the 
\emph on
myTaxiService
\emph default
 system and the resources used to draw up this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The second section describes some preliminary results for cost estimation.
 A brief theoretical introduction about Function Points method will be provided
 and then it will be applied to the myTaxiService system in order to estimate
 the complexity of the project and derive the expected number of SLOC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The third section is devoted to cost estimation.
 A general method, called COCOMO, will be presented and applied to the specific
 case of myTaxiService in order to estimate the effort of the project, the
 estimated time needed for the fulfillment and the number of people required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the fourth section we discuss project planning and in particular, according
 to the activities identified we propose a possible schedule, according
 to both the real deadlines and some reasonable considerations.
 We also provide a graphical representation of the schedule by means of
 a Gantt chart.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The fifth section is still devoted to project planning but the focus is
 on the resource allocation.
 Some general consideration will be given and the allocation strategy explained,
 we will also use a resource chart to clarify the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The sixth section is devoted to risk management.
 The main risks affecting the myTaxiService project will be stated according
 to the traditional classification.
 Some consideration about the strategy adopted to tackle them will be given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The appendix contains a brief description of the tools used to produce this
 documents and the number of hours each group member has worked towards
 the fulfillment of this deadline and the revision history.
